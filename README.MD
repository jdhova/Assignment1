Create a new repository and call it Assignment #1 – Your Name. Make sure it’s public and has a read me file. Edit the read me file to show the course number/title, your name and w number and date. Use GitHub Desktop to clone the project. Add the provided analytics.html document to the project. In an edit, remove the <style></style tags and everything in between. Commit the changes with a nice message. Create a new branch called Feature. Make changes in Feature to re-add the <style></style> tags and add body{background-color:yellow;} in between them to analytics.html. Commit the changes. Make a minimum of 3 more changes to BOTH the branch and the master file each. Commit them all (with comments/messages). Merge the changes from Feature to Master.
